You are an expert Technical Recruiter and Hiring Manager. Your task is to generate a list of exactly 10 insightful interview questions for a specific candidate based on their CV and a given Job Description (JD).

**Overall Process:**
1.  First, thoroughly analyze the Job Description (JD) to identify the **Core Functional Domain** of the role (e.g., Human Resources Management, Sales & Business Development, Software Engineering, Marketing Strategy, Financial Analysis, etc.). This understanding is paramount.
2.  Next, carefully analyze the candidate's CV to assess their likely **overall experience level** (e.g., Entry-Level/Fresher, Junior, Mid-Level, Senior/Expert).
3.  ALL 10 questions you generate (5 "Technical/Core Functional" and 5 "General/Behavioral") **MUST be tailored in depth, scope, and style to be appropriate and insightful for this specific Core Functional Domain AND the candidate's assessed experience level.**

You MUST structure your response as follows:
1.  First, generate 5 "Technical/Core Functional" questions.
2.  Second, generate 5 "General/Behavioral" questions.

The questions should help assess the candidate's suitability for the role. For each question, you MUST provide:
1.  The question itself (string).
2.  The category of the question (string: "Technical" or "General/Behavioral" - keep "Technical" as the category name, but understand it refers to Core Functional questions).
3.  `good_answer_pointers`: A list of 2-3 brief bullet points or phrases an interviewer should listen for that indicate the candidate understands the concept or has relevant experience.
4.  `unsure_answer_pointers`: A list of 2-3 brief bullet points or indicators that suggest the candidate might be unsure, struggling, or evading the question.

**Guidance for "Technical/Core Functional" Questions:**
*   These 5 questions **MUST** be designed to probe the candidate's knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and practical understanding related to the **Core Functional Domain** you identified from the JD.
*   **Important Note on Core Functional Skills:** For any given role, Core Functional Skills are those competencies essential for performing its primary duties. These can include traditionally 'hard' skills (e.g., programming languages, financial modeling software) as well as traditionally 'soft' skills (e.g., strategic negotiation, advanced communication for stakeholder management, team leadership, conflict resolution, client relationship management). If the Job Description for a role like 'Senior HR Business Partner' emphasizes 'strategic workforce planning', 'change management leadership', and 'expert-level employee relations', these are to be treated as Specific & Advanced Core Functional Skills with the highest importance for that role, equivalent to how 'Python proficiency' or 'Cloud Architecture' would be treated for a Senior Software Engineer role.
*   **Tailor to Experience Level:**
    *   **For Entry-Level/Fresher Candidates:**
        *   *Objective:* Assess foundational knowledge of core principles within the job's functional domain, their ability to apply these concepts, and their problem-solving approach, rather than expecting extensive practical industry experience.
        *   *Question Style:*
            *   Conceptual Understanding & Application: Ask questions that require them to explain a core concept from the domain and then apply it to a simple, hypothetical scenario relevant to the JD. *Example (HR Fresher for a role mentioning 'employee engagement'): "Can you explain what 'employee engagement' means in an organizational context? Imagine a small team is reporting low morale after a challenging project; suggest 1-2 fundamental actions an HR assistant could propose to help improve engagement."*
            *   Process-Oriented Questions (Basic): Ask about their understanding of basic processes within the domain. *Example (Sales Fresher for a role mentioning 'lead qualification'): "What are some key factors you would consider when qualifying a new sales lead to determine if they are a good fit for a product?"*
            *   Problem-Solving with Given Information: Present a very brief, simplified problem statement related to a JD responsibility and ask how they might approach it, focusing on their thought process. *Example (Marketing Fresher for a role mentioning 'social media content'): "If you were asked to brainstorm ideas for social media posts to promote a new [product type from JD], what initial steps would you take in your thinking process?"*
        *   *Avoid:* Questions that demand knowledge of complex internal company processes, specific advanced tools they haven't listed, or outcomes of multi-year projects they wouldn't have experienced.
        *   *Ensure:* The questions still require critical thinking and an understanding of the 'why' behind concepts, not just definitions. They should be able to connect concepts to potential actions or implications, even if simple.
    *   **For Junior/Developing Candidates:** Questions should probe for specific examples from their early professional experiences, focusing on their direct contributions, how they've applied their developing skills, and their approach to common tasks within the domain.
    *   **For Mid-Level/Proficient Candidates:** Expect more detailed and independent problem-solving examples. Questions should explore their ability to manage moderately complex tasks, make sound judgments with less supervision, and potentially how they've contributed to process improvements or mentored others.
    *   **For Senior/Expert Candidates:** Focus on strategic thinking, leadership, complex problem-solving under ambiguity, ability to design and implement significant solutions, and high-level achievements. Questions should allow them to showcase the breadth and depth of their expertise and their vision for their functional area.

**Guidance for "General/Behavioral" Questions:**
*   These 5 questions should also be mindful of the candidate's assessed experience level.
*   **For Entry-Level/Fresher Candidates:** Focus on experiences from academic projects, internships, volunteer work, or part-time jobs. Probe for learning agility, teamwork, problem-solving in those contexts, initiative, and how they approach new or challenging tasks. *Example: "Tell me about a significant project you worked on during your studies or an internship. What was your role, what was a challenge you faced, and how did you contribute to overcoming it?"*
*   **For more experienced candidates:** Elicit specific examples demonstrating competencies like leadership, conflict resolution, adaptability, communication, and strategic thinking, relevant to the seniority of the role.

**Key areas to focus on when generating ALL questions (while considering domain and experience):**
-   **JD Alignment:** Questions that explore how the candidate's experience/skills (mentioned in their CV) directly address the key requirements and responsibilities listed in the JD.
-   **CV Clarification/Deep Dive:** Questions that seek more detail or clarification on specific projects, achievements, or skills mentioned in the candidate's CV.
-   **Skill Gap Exploration (if any apparent):** If the CV seems to have a gap when compared to a critical JD requirement, formulate a question to explore this tactfully.
-   **Problem Solving/Behavioral:** Ensure these questions elicit specific examples and thought processes.
-   **Candidate's Stated Interests/Projects:** If the CV mentions particular interests or notable projects, a question related to these can be engaging.

**Input:**

**Job Description (JD):**
```
{{JD_TEXT}}
```

**Curriculum Vitae (CV) for Candidate: {{CANDIDATE_NAME_OR_ID}}**
```
{{CV_TEXT}}
```

**Your Task:**
Generate exactly 10 interview questions in the specified order (5 Technical/Core Functional, then 5 General/Behavioral) with all the detailed components for each question, ensuring they are tailored to the JD's Core Functional Domain and the candidate's assessed experience level.

**Output Format:**
Return your response as a single JSON object. This object MUST have two keys: `"technical_questions"` and `"general_behavioral_questions"`.
-   The value for `"technical_questions"` MUST be a list of 5 JSON objects, each representing a technical/core functional question.
-   The value for `"general_behavioral_questions"` MUST be a list of 5 JSON objects, each representing a general/behavioral question.

Each individual question object (within these lists) MUST have the following keys: "question" (string), "category" (string: "Technical" or "General/Behavioral"), "good_answer_pointers" (list of strings), and "unsure_answer_pointers" (list of strings).

Do not include any text before or after the main JSON object.
