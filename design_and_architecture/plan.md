Smart Recruit employs a modern architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A Streamlit-based user interface for recruiter interaction
2. **Backend API**: A FastAPI application providing structured endpoints
3. **LLM Services**: Integration with multiple LLM providers for document analysis
4. **Vector Database**: Qdrant for efficient similarity search of documents
5. **Utilities**: Support modules for file handling, logging, and validation

## 3. Key Workflows

### 3.1 S3-Based JD Processing Workflow

   - **Weighted Chunking**: LLM assigns importance weights (1-3) to each chunk
   - **Rich Metadata**: Store S3 provenance, file size, content type, processing timestamps
   - **Enhanced Embeddings**: Generate embeddings from LLM-enriched content
3. Frontend displays structured JD data with processing status and S3 metadata

### 3.2 S3-Based CV Processing Workflow with Retry Logic
1. User provides S3 URI for CV document
2. Backend processes with sophisticated retry mechanism:
   - **S3 Integration**: Download with metadata extraction and validation
   - **Retry Logic**: Up to 2 attempts with 3-second exponential backoff
   - **Parallel Processing**: LLM parsing and vector storage run concurrently
   - **Granular Error Tracking**: Separate success flags for DB and LLM operations
   - **Context Preservation**: Maintain error history across retry attempts
   - **Rich Metadata**: Complete S3 provenance tracking
3. Frontend displays detailed processing status with retry information and error context

### 3.3 Advanced CV Ranking Workflow with Optimization

     - Detailed logging of match analysis
   - **Stage 2**: Parallel LLM-based comparison with robust error handling
   - **Performance**: 3-5x faster for small batches through optimization
3. Frontend displays ranked candidates with LLM reasoning (vector scores hidden)

### 3.4 Enhanced Question Generation Workflow
1. User selects a ranked candidate
2. Backend generates personalized interview questions with advanced features:

## 9. Data Flow Summary

1.  **User uploads JD/CVs (PDFs, DOCX, TXT) via Streamlit UI.**
2.  **`app.py`** sends file contents to **`routes.py`** API endpoints via HTTP requests.
3.  **Backend Processing (JD Example):**
    *   **Structured Parsing**: `routes.py` calls `src/services/jd_service.parse_jd_with_llm()`, which uses `src/llm/parser.parse_document()` with `prompts/json_output_jd_prompt.md` to extract structured data from the JD.
    *   **Chunking & Vectorization**: `routes.py` calls `src/services/jd_service.process_jd()`, which:
        *   Uses `src/llm/chunker.chunk_document_with_llm()` with `prompts/jd_enrich_prompt.md` to divide the document into semantic chunks.
        *   Each chunk contains `og_content` (original text) and `enriched_content` (LLM-enhanced text).
        *   Calls `src/vector_db/jd_repository.add_jd_to_db()` to process and store chunks.
        *   For each chunk, the `enriched_content` is embedded using the Sentence Transformer model.
        *   Stores original content, enriched content, embeddings, and metadata in Qdrant.
4.  **CV Processing is analogous**, using `src/services/cv_service` with appropriate CV-specific prompts and repositories.
5.  **Ranking:**
    *   Triggered from UI, handled by `routes.py` calling `src/services/ranking_service.calculate_cv_ranking()`.
    *   Initial vector similarity stage uses `src/vector_db/client.search_similar_chunks()` to find best matches based on embedding similarity.
    *   LLM reasoning stage retrieves full documents via `get_full_document_text_from_db()` and compares with LLM using `prompts/jd_cv_comparison_prompt.md`.
6.  **Question Generation:**
    *   Triggered from UI, handled by `routes.py` calling `src/services/question_service.generate_candidate_questions()`.
    *   Retrieves full JD and CV texts, then uses LLM with `prompts/candidate_questions_prompt.md` to generate questions.
7.  **Results are returned to the frontend** for display to the user.

## 10. Extensibility

- Modular design allows for adding new LLM prompts, models (via `config.py`), or ranking strategies.
- Schemas in `schemas/` can be updated to change data structures.
- Centralized `config.py` for API keys and model choices.

## 12. Example Processing Scenario (Conceptual Update)

The core idea remains: unstructured PDF -> structured JSON -> chunked & enriched text -> embeddings -> similarity search -> LLM reasoning.

Key difference in flow:
- PDF base64 is first sent to a **Multimodal LLM** with an "enrichment" prompt (e.g., `prompts/JD_enrich_prompt.md`) to get `og_content` and `enriched_content` for each chunk.
- The `enriched_content` of these chunks is then fed to the **Sentence Transformer** to create embeddings for Qdrant.
- The `og_content` is stored and used later for reconstructing full documents for the **Text LLM** reasoning stages (ranking, question generation).

This ensures that embeddings are generated from LLM-refined text, potentially improving relevance, while the original text is preserved for human readability and detailed LLM analysis.
